Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. 
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which 
describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, 
and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, 
but you’ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. 
Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

TASKS
1-Review Starter Code:
Examine the provided arrays of credit card numbers, including valid, invalid, and mystery arrays, as well as the batch array.

2-Create validateCred() Function:
Implement a function to check if a credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm.

3-Create findInvalidCards() Function:
Develop a function to identify invalid credit card numbers from a nested array and return them.

4-Create idInvalidCardCompanies() Function:
Write a function to determine which companies issued invalid credit card numbers and return an array of these companies.

5-Optional Challenges:
Test your functions with different credit card numbers, create a function to convert strings to arrays, and develop a function to convert invalid numbers to valid ones.
